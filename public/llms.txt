# FlipChecker

> FlipChecker is a Chrome extension that shows eBay sold listing prices directly on Facebook Marketplace item pages, helping resellers instantly calculate profit potential without leaving the page.

FlipChecker bridges the gap between local sourcing on Facebook Marketplace and global pricing data from eBay. Instead of manually searching eBay in a separate tab for every listing, resellers see an overlay with real eBay sold prices, profit estimates, and deal quality scores right on the Facebook Marketplace page they're browsing.

## Core Features

- Real-time eBay price overlay on Facebook Marketplace listings
- Profit calculator with automatic fee estimation (eBay, shipping, platform fees)
- Deal quality scoring based on price spread between ask and sold prices
- Save and track deals from your dashboard
- Price alerts for items you're watching
- Scam detection warnings for suspiciously low prices

## Pricing

- Free: 10 price lookups/day, 25 saved deals, 1 price alert, basic estimates
- Flipper ($19/mo): 100 lookups/day, 500 saved deals, 10 alerts, real eBay active listings
- Pro ($39/mo): 500 lookups/day, unlimited saved deals, 50 alerts, real eBay sold data, advanced analytics

## Use Cases

- Facebook Marketplace to eBay arbitrage
