# FlipChecker - Complete Product Information

> FlipChecker is a Chrome extension and web platform that helps Facebook Marketplace resellers make data-driven buying decisions by comparing local asking prices against real eBay sold listing data in real-time.

## Problem FlipChecker Solves

Resellers who buy items on Facebook Marketplace to resell on eBay currently waste 5-15 minutes per listing manually researching prices. The process involves: opening a new tab, navigating to eBay, searching for the item, filtering by "Sold" listings, scrolling through results, mentally calculating fees and shipping, and deciding whether the Facebook price represents a profitable opportunity. This friction means resellers either miss time-sensitive deals or make uninformed purchases that result in losses.

FlipChecker eliminates this friction entirely by displaying eBay pricing data as an overlay directly on the Facebook Marketplace listing page. A reseller can evaluate a deal's profit potential in under 5 seconds without ever leaving Facebook.

## How It Works

1. Install the FlipChecker Chrome extension
2. Browse Facebook Marketplace normally
3. When viewing any Marketplace listing, FlipChecker automatically captures the item details using AI-powered vision extraction
4. The extension queries eBay's API for matching sold and active listings
5. An overlay appears on the page showing: eBay price range (low/median/high), estimated profit after fees, sample sold listings, and a direct link to eBay search results
6. Save deals to your dashboard for tracking, set price alerts, and monitor your flip portfolio

## Technical Architecture

- Chrome Extension (Manifest v3) with AI-powered data extraction
- Next.js web application for dashboard, authentication, and account management

## Target Audience

FlipChecker serves the Facebook Marketplace reselling community, which ranges from:
- **Casual side hustlers**: People looking to make extra income by flipping items they find locally
- **Part-time resellers**: People running a reselling side business doing 10-50 flips per month
- **Full-time professional resellers**: People who source inventory from Facebook Marketplace, estate sales, and thrift stores to resell on eBay, Mercari, and Poshmark as their primary income
- **Local arbitrageurs**: People who buy underpriced items on one local marketplace and resell on global platforms

## Key Differentiators

1. **Facebook Marketplace focus**: Unlike Zik Analytics, SellerAmp, BuyBotPro, and Keepa which focus on Amazon/eBay product research, FlipChecker is purpose-built for Facebook Marketplace sourcing
2. **Real-time overlay**: Data appears directly on the Facebook page — no tab switching, no separate app
3. **Vision-powered extraction**: Uses AI vision to read listing data from screenshots, making it resilient to Facebook's frequent DOM changes
4. **Beginner-friendly**: Simple overlay with clear profit/loss indicators vs complex dashboards with dozens of metrics
5. **Generous free tier**: 10 free lookups per day allows casual users to get value immediately
