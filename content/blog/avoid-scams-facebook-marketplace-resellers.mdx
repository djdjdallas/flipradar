faqs:
  - question: "What are the most common Facebook Marketplace scams targeting resellers?"
    answer: "The most common scams are fake listings (stolen photos, no actual item), counterfeit goods (fake AirPods, designer bags), broken items sold as working, stolen property, and deposit scams where sellers ask for money to 'hold' items."
  - question: "How can I tell if a Facebook Marketplace seller is legitimate?"
    answer: "Check for an established profile (several years old), previous marketplace activity and ratings, willingness to meet in public, multiple clear photos of the actual item, and reasonable responsiveness to questions. Be wary of new profiles with no history."
  - question: "Is it safe to meet Facebook Marketplace sellers in person?"
    answer: "Yes, if you follow safety protocols: meet in well-lit public places (police station parking lots are ideal), bring someone with you, meet during daytime, tell someone where you're going, and trust your instincts to walk away if something feels wrong."
  - question: "What should I do if I suspect an item is stolen?"
    answer: "Don't buy it. Red flags include no receipt or proof of purchase, serial numbers scratched off or removed, seller has multiple high-value items at low prices, vague answers about where items came from. Report suspicious listings to Facebook and local police."

Facebook Marketplace is an incredible sourcing platform for resellers, but it also attracts scammers who target people looking for deals. As a reseller, you're particularly vulnerable because you're actively seeking underpriced items and making frequent purchases with cash.

Understanding common scams and how to protect yourself is essential for building a sustainable, safe flipping business.

## The Most Common Scams Targeting Resellers

### Fake Listings (Bait and Switch)

**How It Works**: Scammers post listings with photos stolen from other sites or previous legitimate listings. The item either doesn't exist, is different from photos, or is in much worse condition than described.

**Red Flags**:
- Photos look professional or like stock images
- When you ask for additional photos, seller makes excuses or sends more stock images
- Seller won't provide photos with current date/your name on paper in photo
- Price is dramatically below market value (50-70% off)
- Seller is vague about item details or contradicts themselves

**Protection Strategy**:
- Always ask for photos showing the item from multiple angles
- Request a photo with a piece of paper showing today's date
- Use reverse image search (Google Images) to check if photos appear elsewhere online
- If seller can't provide requested photos, walk away

### Counterfeit Goods

**How It Works**: Scammers sell fake versions of popular items, particularly electronics and designer goods. Common fakes include AirPods, designer handbags, game controllers, and branded clothing.

**Most Commonly Faked Items**:
- Apple AirPods (all generations)
- Designer handbags (Coach, Louis Vuitton, Gucci)
- Game controllers (PlayStation, Xbox Elite)
- Beats headphones
- Luxury watches
- Nike/Adidas shoes

**Red Flags**:
- Price significantly below retail (brand new AirPods Pro for $80)
- Seller has multiple "new in box" luxury items
- Packaging has misspellings or quality issues
- Weight feels wrong (fakes are often lighter)
- Build quality is poor (uneven gaps, cheap materials)

**Protection Strategy**:
- Learn authentication markers for items you frequently buy
- Check serial numbers on manufacturer websites (Apple, Sony, etc.)
- Inspect packaging closely for quality and spelling
- Test functionality thoroughly (fakes often have connectivity or sound issues)
- If buying designer goods, ask for receipt or authentication paperwork

### "Broken" Items Sold As Working

**How It Works**: Seller lists an item as working but it's actually broken or has significant functionality issues. They rely on buyers not testing thoroughly at pickup.

**Common Examples**:
- Game console that powers on but doesn't read discs
- Phone with cracked screen under screen protector
- Laptop with dead battery sold "not tested"
- Power tools with burnt-out motors
- Cameras with broken autofocus

**Red Flags**:
- Seller won't demonstrate item working
- "Not tested" or "as-is" in description
- Refuses to show specific functionality (disc reading, charging, etc.)
- Won't remove screen protector or case during inspection
- Pushes for quick transaction without thorough testing

**Protection Strategy**:
- Always test items completely before paying
- Bring necessary accessories (chargers, cables) to test
- For electronics, verify every function (don't just check if it powers on)
- Walk away if seller won't allow thorough testing
- For "as-is" items, price accordingly assuming repairs needed

### Stolen Property

**How It Works**: Stolen items are sold on Facebook Marketplace, often quickly and at prices well below market value. Buying stolen goods can result in legal problems and losing both the item and your money.

**Red Flags**:
- Seller has many high-value items listed (multiple phones, laptops, game consoles)
- Can't provide proof of purchase or receipt
- Serial numbers are scratched off or removed
- Items are very new but sold significantly below retail
- Seller seems nervous, rushed, or evasive about questions
- Meeting location is unusual (empty parking lot, dark area)
- No original packaging for relatively new items

**Protection Strategy**:
- Ask for receipt or proof of purchase for high-value items
- Check if seller's Facebook profile matches the type of items (does this person logically own these items?)
- Be extra cautious with sealed/new items sold well below retail
- Walk away from deals that seem too good to be true
- Report suspicious listings to Facebook and local police

### Deposit and Holding Fee Scams

**How It Works**: Scammer asks for a deposit or "holding fee" via Venmo, CashApp, or PayPal to reserve an item. They then disappear with your money, and either the item doesn't exist or they sell it to someone else anyway.

**Common Variations**:
- "I have multiple people interested, send $50 to hold it"
- "Pay half now, half at pickup"
- "Shipping requires prepayment"
- "I'm working now, send deposit and pick up tomorrow"

**Red Flags**:
- Any request for payment before seeing item in person
- Pressure to send money quickly
- Refusing cash-only transaction at pickup
- Claiming PayPal/Venmo is for "security"

**Protection Strategy**:
- Never send money before seeing and inspecting item in person
- Only pay cash at pickup after inspecting item
- If seller insists on deposit, it's a scam - walk away
- Tell seller you'll pay full cash at pickup; if they refuse, block them

### Payment App Scams

**How It Works**: During or after meeting, scammer sends you a fake payment confirmation or requests you send them money for various reasons.

**Common Variations**:
- Shows fake payment confirmation screenshot, claims payment is pending
- Sends you a fake email pretending to be from PayPal/Venmo
- Claims their payment app isn't working, asks you to send payment first as "test"
- After you buy an item with cash, contacts you claiming to be a victim of fraud asking for refund

**Protection Strategy**:
- Only accept cash for Facebook Marketplace transactions
- Verify payment actually arrived in your account before handing over item
- Don't accept screenshots as proof of payment
- Block anyone asking you to send them money for any reason

### Meetup Safety Scams

**How It Works**: While less common, some criminals use Facebook Marketplace to set up meetups for robbery.

**Red Flags**:
- Insists on meeting at their home or isolated location
- Changes meeting location last minute to somewhere more remote
- Asks what else you'll be buying/how much cash you're carrying
- Multiple people present at pickup when seller said they'd be alone
- Meeting location is in a deserted area, late at night

**Protection Strategy**:
- Always meet in public, well-lit, busy locations
- Police station parking lots are ideal (stations often have "safe exchange zones")
- Bring someone with you, especially for high-value items
- Meet during daytime or early evening
- Tell someone where you're going and when you expect to return
- Trust your instincts - if something feels wrong, leave

## Safe Transaction Best Practices

Follow these protocols for every Facebook Marketplace purchase:

### Before Contact

1. **Research Market Value**: Know what the item actually sells for so you recognize unrealistic prices
2. **Check Seller Profile**: Look at profile age, marketplace history, ratings
3. **Review Listing Thoroughly**: Study photos, read description carefully
4. **Verify with eBay Sold Listings**: Use FlipChecker or manual search to confirm market value

### During Communication

1. **Use Facebook Messenger**: Keep communications on-platform for accountability
2. **Ask Specific Questions**: Test seller's knowledge about the item
3. **Request Additional Photos**: Ask for photos from different angles, with current date
4. **Verify Functionality**: Ask what works and what doesn't
5. **Propose Public Meeting Place**: Gauge seller's reaction

### At Pickup

1. **Meet in Public**: Police stations, busy parking lots, coffee shops during business hours
2. **Bring Someone**: Especially for high-value items or first-time meetups
3. **Inspect Thoroughly**: Test all functions before paying
4. **Bring Exact Cash**: Don't show large amounts of money
5. **Trust Your Gut**: If anything feels wrong, politely decline and leave

### After Purchase

1. **Test Again at Home**: Thoroughly test item before listing on eBay
2. **Keep Records**: Save seller contact info and receipts if possible
3. **Report Issues**: If item was misrepresented, report to Facebook
4. **Leave Review**: Help other buyers by leaving honest marketplace review

## Category-Specific Scam Warnings

Different product categories have specific scams to watch for:

### Electronics

- **iCloud/Account Lock**: iPads, iPhones, MacBooks locked to previous owner's account are worthless. Always verify device can be factory reset and is signed out of all accounts
- **ESN/IMEI Blacklisted**: Phones reported stolen are blacklisted and won't work on carriers
- **Water Damage**: Electronics sold as working may have internal water damage that appears later

**Verification**: Ask to factory reset device during pickup, check IMEI status on carrier websites

### Designer Goods

- **Sophisticated Fakes**: Some counterfeits are very convincing
- **"Replica" Disclosure**: Sellers sometimes bury "inspired by" or "replica" in description

**Verification**: Learn authentication details (stitching, serial numbers, materials), ask for receipt

### Tools

- **Refurbished Sold as New**: Old tools cleaned up and sold as new
- **Compatible Batteries**: Aftermarket batteries that don't hold charge

**Verification**: Check date codes, test battery life, inspect for wear

### Collectibles

- **Reproductions**: Vintage items that are actually modern reproductions
- **Restoration Not Disclosed**: Heavily restored/repainted items sold as original

**Verification**: Research markings and production details, ask about restoration

## What To Do If You're Scammed

If you realize you've been scammed:

**Immediately**:
1. **Stop Payment**: If you used PayPal or similar, dispute immediately
2. **Report to Facebook**: Report listing and user
3. **Document Everything**: Screenshot listings, messages, photos
4. **File Police Report**: For stolen goods or fraud over $100

**For Buyer Protection**:
- Cash transactions offer no recourse
- PayPal Goods & Services offers some protection (but most FB Marketplace sellers require cash)
- Credit cards offer chargeback protection (not applicable for cash)

**Report Scams To**:
- Facebook Marketplace support
- Local police department (for in-person fraud or stolen goods)
- FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (for large amounts or organized schemes)
- Better Business Bureau

## Building a Scam Detection Instinct

After 20-30 purchases, you'll develop an intuition for what's legitimate vs suspicious. You'll recognize patterns:

- Legitimate sellers answer questions thoroughly and confidently
- Real items have consistent photos showing actual wear and use
- Honest sellers volunteer information about flaws
- Reasonable prices align with market value

Meanwhile, scammers:
- Give vague or evasive answers
- Use high-pressure tactics
- Have stories that don't quite make sense
- Price too far below market without good reason

Trust this instinct. Walking away from a questionable deal isn't losing an opportunity - it's protecting your business.

## The Role of Research in Scam Prevention

The single best protection against scams is knowing market values. When you know that AirPods Pro sell for $180-200 on eBay, you immediately recognize a $60 listing as suspicious.

FlipChecker helps by showing eBay sold prices directly on Facebook Marketplace listings. This instant price verification helps you spot both genuine deals and deals that are "too good to be true." When you see that an item is priced at 20% of market value, you know to be extra cautious and scrutinize the listing carefully.

Quick price verification also reduces pressure. Scammers often use urgency ("multiple people interested, need to sell today") to push you into quick decisions. When you can verify market value in 5 seconds instead of 5 minutes, you make calmer, more informed decisions.
