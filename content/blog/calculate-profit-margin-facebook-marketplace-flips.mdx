faqs:
  - question: "What is the formula for calculating profit on Facebook Marketplace flips?"
    answer: "The formula is: (eBay sale price × 0.87) - Facebook Marketplace purchase price - shipping cost - packaging = net profit. The 0.87 multiplier accounts for eBay's 13% final value fee."
  - question: "What fees do I need to account for when flipping to eBay?"
    answer: "You need to account for eBay's final value fee (13% for most categories), payment processing fees (typically 3%), shipping costs, and packaging materials. Combined, fees typically take about 16% of your sale price."
  - question: "What's a good profit margin for flipping items?"
    answer: "A good profit margin is 40-50% for items under $50 and 30-40% for items over $50. This ensures you're making worthwhile profit after accounting for all costs and time invested."
  - question: "How do I calculate profit margin percentage?"
    answer: "Profit margin percentage = (Net Profit ÷ Sale Price) × 100. For example, if you buy for $30, sell for $60, and have $10 in fees/shipping, your profit is $20. The margin is (20 ÷ 60) × 100 = 33%."

Understanding how to calculate profit margins is the difference between building a profitable flipping business and wasting time on deals that barely break even. Many beginners focus only on the purchase price and selling price, forgetting the numerous costs that erode their profits.

This guide will teach you the exact formulas professional resellers use to calculate true profit margins, complete with real-world examples and a simple reference table you can bookmark.

## The Complete Profit Formula

Here's the formula that accounts for every cost involved in flipping from Facebook Marketplace to eBay:

**Net Profit = (eBay Sale Price × 0.87) - Purchase Price - Shipping Cost - Packaging Cost - Pickup Cost**

Let's break down each component:

**eBay Sale Price × 0.87**: This multiplier accounts for eBay's 13% final value fee on most categories. Some categories charge different rates (12.9% for musical instruments, 15% for luxury handbags), but 13% is the standard for most items.

Note that this simplified formula combines the eBay fee with payment processing. A more precise calculation would be: Sale Price × 0.87 (for 13% eBay fee) × 0.97 (for 3% payment processing fee) = Sale Price × 0.844. However, most resellers use 0.84-0.87 as a quick mental calculation.

**Purchase Price**: What you actually paid the Facebook Marketplace seller. If you negotiated down from the asking price, use the negotiated amount.

**Shipping Cost**: The actual cost charged by USPS, UPS, or FedEx. Use eBay's shipping calculator or check rates directly with carriers. Don't forget to account for item weight and box dimensions.

**Packaging Cost**: Boxes, bubble wrap, tape, labels. This typically runs $2-5 per item depending on size. Buy supplies in bulk to reduce this cost.

**Pickup Cost**: Gas and time to collect the item. For nearby pickups, this is negligible. For items requiring a 30-minute drive, factor in $5-10.

## Three Real-World Examples

Let's walk through detailed calculations for three different items to see how this formula works in practice.

### Example 1: Vintage Video Game Console

You find a Nintendo 64 console with two controllers and 5 games listed on Facebook Marketplace for $80. Recent eBay sold listings show similar bundles selling for $160-180.

**Calculation:**
- eBay sale price (conservative estimate): $170
- After fees ($170 × 0.84): $143
- Purchase price: -$80
- Shipping (it's 5 lbs): -$12
- Packaging (medium box, bubble wrap): -$4
- Pickup cost (10 min drive): -$2
- **Net Profit: $45**

**Profit Margin:** ($45 ÷ $170) × 100 = 26.5%

**Return on Investment (ROI):** ($45 ÷ $80) × 100 = 56%

This is a solid flip. You're making $45 on an $80 investment, which is a 56% ROI. The profit margin of 26.5% is healthy for an item in this price range.

### Example 2: Designer Handbag

You spot a Coach purse in excellent condition for $60. Checking eBay sold listings for this exact model, you see they're selling for $120-140.

**Calculation:**
- eBay sale price (conservative): $125
- After fees ($125 × 0.85, using 15% for luxury bags): $106
- Purchase price: -$60
- Shipping (2 lbs with insurance): -$10
- Packaging (branded box, tissue): -$5
- Pickup cost: -$3
- **Net Profit: $28**

**Profit Margin:** ($28 ÷ $125) × 100 = 22.4%

**ROI:** ($28 ÷ $60) × 100 = 46.7%

Still a good flip with $28 profit, though the margin is lower due to eBay's higher fees on luxury items.

### Example 3: Power Tool

A DeWalt impact driver combo kit is listed for $90. The seller mentions it's barely used with battery and charger. eBay sold listings show these kits selling for $180-200.

**Calculation:**
- eBay sale price: $190
- After fees ($190 × 0.84): $160
- Purchase price: -$90
- Shipping (heavy, 8 lbs): -$18
- Packaging (large box, plenty of protection): -$6
- Pickup cost: -$0 (seller meets you nearby)
- **Net Profit: $46**

**Profit Margin:** ($46 ÷ $190) × 100 = 24.2%

**ROI:** ($46 ÷ $90) × 100 = 51%

Excellent flip with $46 profit, though shipping eats into margins due to weight.

## Understanding Payment Processing Fees

In addition to eBay's final value fee, you'll pay payment processing fees. eBay's managed payments system charges approximately 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.

For simplicity, most resellers round this to 3% when doing quick calculations. So the total platform fees become:

- 13% eBay final value fee
- 3% payment processing
- **Total: 16% in fees**

This is why using 0.84 as your multiplier (representing 16% total fees) gives you a realistic profit estimate.

Some resellers use 0.87 (representing 13% fees only) and then subtract payment processing separately. Either method works as long as you're consistent.

## The Quick Reference Profit Table

Here's a simple table showing profit calculations for common price points. This assumes standard 16% fees and $8 average shipping:

| Purchase Price | eBay Sale Price | After Fees (×0.84) | Shipping | Net Profit | Profit Margin |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|------------|---------------|
| $20 | $50 | $42 | -$8 | $14 | 28% |
| $40 | $80 | $67 | -$10 | $17 | 21% |
| $60 | $120 | $101 | -$12 | $29 | 24% |
| $80 | $150 | $126 | -$12 | $34 | 23% |
| $100 | $180 | $151 | -$15 | $36 | 20% |
| $150 | $250 | $210 | -$15 | $45 | 18% |
| $200 | $350 | $294 | -$18 | $76 | 22% |

This table illustrates an important pattern: as item prices increase, profit margins often compress slightly, but total dollar profit increases. A $76 profit on a $200 investment is excellent even though it's "only" a 22% margin.

## Category-Specific Fee Variations

While 13% is eBay's standard final value fee, some categories have different rates:

**Higher Fees (15% or more):**
- Luxury handbags and accessories
- Watches (some categories)
- Fine jewelry

**Lower Fees (around 12%):**
- Musical instruments and gear (12.9%)
- Business and industrial equipment
- Some collectibles

Always check the actual fee structure for your specific category on eBay's fee page. Luxury items typically carry higher fees, which you need to factor into your profit calculations.

## Hidden Costs to Remember

Beyond the obvious fees, don't forget these costs that can sneak up on you:

**Return Shipping**: If you offer free returns (which can boost sales), you'll occasionally eat the cost of return shipping. Budget about 5% of revenue for potential returns if you're offering this.

**Storage Costs**: If you're storing inventory at home, this is essentially free. But if you're renting storage space or have opportunity cost in using a spare room, factor this in.

**Time Value**: Your time has value. If you're spending 2 hours per flip and making $30, that's $15/hour. Decide whether that meets your income goals.

**Listing Fees**: Most eBay stores include a certain number of free listings, but extra listings beyond your allocation cost $0.35 each.

**Promotional Fees**: If you use eBay's promoted listings feature to boost visibility, you'll pay an additional percentage (typically 5-10%) on items sold through promotions.

## Calculating Profit Margin vs. ROI

These are two different but important metrics:

**Profit Margin** shows what percentage of the sale price is profit:
- Formula: (Net Profit ÷ Sale Price) × 100
- Example: $30 profit on $100 sale = 30% margin

**Return on Investment (ROI)** shows the return on your money invested:
- Formula: (Net Profit ÷ Purchase Price) × 100
- Example: $30 profit on $50 purchase = 60% ROI

ROI is often more important for resellers because it shows how efficiently you're using your capital. A 60% ROI means you're growing your money by 60% per flip.

If you can complete 10 flips per month with an average 60% ROI, you're effectively earning 600% annually on your invested capital (though this doesn't account for time value).

## What's a "Good" Profit Margin?

Target profit margins vary by price range:

**Items Under $50:**
- Minimum: 40% margin
- Good: 50-60% margin
- Excellent: 70%+ margin

Lower-priced items require higher margins because the absolute dollar profit is smaller. A 30% margin on a $30 item is only $9 profit, which might not be worth your time.

**Items $50-150:**
- Minimum: 30% margin
- Good: 35-45% margin
- Excellent: 50%+ margin

**Items Over $150:**
- Minimum: 25% margin
- Good: 30-40% margin
- Excellent: 45%+ margin

Higher-priced items can have lower margins because the absolute profit is still substantial. A 25% margin on a $400 item is $100 profit, which is excellent.
