faqs:
  - question: "Why compare to eBay instead of other platforms?"
    answer: "eBay publicly displays sold listing prices, giving you real market data. Other platforms like Mercari or Poshmark hide sold prices from non-sellers, making accurate comparisons impossible without manual tracking."
  - question: "How far back should I look at eBay sold listings?"
    answer: "Focus on the past 60-90 days for most items. Recent sales reflect current market demand. For seasonal items like holiday decor, look at the same period from the previous year."
  - question: "What if the item has never sold on eBay?"
    answer: "This could mean several things: the item is too niche for eBay, it's listed under different keywords, or there's genuinely no market. Try broader search terms, check completed listings (not just sold), and consider alternative platforms."
  - question: "Can I use this strategy for negotiating Facebook Marketplace prices?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Showing sellers eBay sold data can justify your lower offer. Be respectful and explain you're using recent market sales to determine fair value. Many sellers appreciate the transparency."

# How to Compare Facebook Marketplace Prices to eBay

The difference between a profitable flip and a money-losing mistake often comes down to one thing: knowing what items actually sell for, not what sellers are asking.

Facebook Marketplace shows asking prices. eBay shows sold prices. That gap is where smart resellers make their money.

This guide teaches you exactly how to compare Facebook Marketplace prices to eBay sold listings so you can buy low locally and sell high online.

## Why Comparing Facebook Marketplace to eBay Matters

Facebook Marketplace sellers typically price items based on:
- What they think it's worth
- What they paid originally
- What similar items are currently listed for (not sold)
- A wild guess

eBay sold listings show you:
- What buyers actually paid
- Real market demand
- Typical price ranges based on condition
- Seasonal trends and pricing velocity

**The result:** You frequently find items on Facebook Marketplace listed 30-60% below their eBay sold prices. These are your profit opportunities.

**Real Example:**

A local seller lists a vintage Nintendo 64 console with two controllers for $80 on Facebook Marketplace. eBay sold listings show similar bundles selling for $145-$165. After eBay fees (13.25%) and shipping costs ($12), you're looking at a net profit of $35-$50 on a single flip.

Without comparing to eBay sold data, you'd have no idea if $80 was a good deal or market rate.

## The Manual Method: Step-by-Step eBay Price Comparison

Before we cover automated tools, let's walk through the manual process every reseller should know.

### Step 1: Identify the Item on Facebook Marketplace

Note the key details from the Facebook listing:
- Item name and model number
- Condition (new, like new, good, fair)
- Included accessories or bundles
- Any defects mentioned

**Example:** "Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones, good condition, includes case and cable, small scuff on headband."

### Step 2: Open eBay and Navigate to Advanced Search

Go to eBay.com and click "Advanced" next to the search bar (or visit ebay.com/sch/ebayadvsearch).

**Critical Setting:** Check the box for "Sold listings" under the search options. This is what separates asking prices from actual sold prices.

### Step 3: Enter Search Terms Strategically

Use the specific model number or exact product name from Facebook Marketplace.

**Good search terms:**
- "Sony WH-1000XM4" (specific model)
- "Canon AE-1 film camera" (brand + model + category)
- "Patagonia Down Sweater Medium" (brand + style + size)

**Poor search terms:**
- "Sony headphones" (too broad)
- "Nice camera" (no useful data)
- "Patagonia jacket" (missing size and style specifics)

**Pro Tip:** If the Facebook listing has a vague title like "gaming console," dig into the photos and description to identify the exact model before searching eBay.

### Step 4: Filter by Condition

eBay's condition filters (New, Refurbished, Used, For parts) dramatically affect prices.

A "Like New" item on Facebook should be compared to eBay's "Used - Like New" or "Excellent" condition sales. Don't compare a heavily used item to new-in-box eBay sales.

**Condition Translation Guide:**
- Facebook "New" = eBay "Brand New"
- Facebook "Like New" = eBay "Used - Like New/Excellent"
- Facebook "Good" = eBay "Used - Good"
- Facebook "Fair" = eBay "Used - Acceptable" or "For parts/not working"

### Step 5: Analyze the Sold Listings Data

Look at the first 15-20 sold listings. Note:

**Average Sold Price:** Add up recent sales and divide. This is your baseline.

**Price Range:** What's the spread between lowest and highest? A narrow range means consistent pricing. A wide range means condition, bundling, or timing matters.

**Sales Velocity:** Did 20 units sell in the past week or past 3 months? High velocity = strong demand and reliable pricing. Low velocity = more risk.

**Outliers:** Ignore the $300 sale when everything else sold for $120-$140. Outliers could be bundles, special editions, or auction anomalies.

**Example Analysis:**

Sony WH-1000XM4 eBay sold listings (past 60 days):
- 43 sales found
- Average: $178
- Range: $145 - $215
- Most common: $170-$185

**Your Decision:** Facebook asking price is $120. eBay average is $178. After 13.25% eBay fees ($23.58), shipping ($10), and your time ($10), estimated profit is $14.42. If you can negotiate to $100, profit jumps to $34.42.

### Step 6: Factor in Fees and Costs

Raw price comparison isn't enough. Subtract:

- **eBay fees:** 13.25% of total sale (item + shipping)
- **PayPal/payment processing:** Usually included in eBay fees now
- **Shipping costs:** Use eBay's shipping calculator
- **Packaging materials:** $2-5 per item
- **Your time:** What's 30 minutes worth to list, pack, and ship?

**Quick Profit Formula:**
```
Profit = (eBay Sold Price - eBay Fees - Shipping Cost) - Facebook Buy Price - Misc Costs
```

For our Sony headphones example:
```
Profit = ($178 - $23.58 - $10) - $120 - $5 = $19.42
```

Is $19.42 worth your time? That depends on your goals and how quickly it'll sell. For a 15-minute flip with fast sales velocity, many resellers would take it.

## The Automated Method: Using FlipChecker

Manual eBay comparisons work but take 3-5 minutes per item. When you're scanning hundreds of Facebook Marketplace listings, that's not scalable.

FlipChecker automates the entire process.

**How FlipChecker Works:**

1. Install the Chrome extension (takes 30 seconds)
2. Browse Facebook Marketplace normally
3. FlipChecker automatically pulls eBay sold data for every listing
4. See average price, range, and number of sales directly on the Facebook listing

**What You See:**

Instead of manually searching eBay, you instantly see an overlay showing:
```
eBay Sold: $178 avg
Range: $145 - $215 (43 sales)
```

Right on the Facebook Marketplace listing. No extra tabs, no searching, no math.

**Time Saved:** 3-5 minutes per item × 50 items browsed = 150-250 minutes per sourcing session. FlipChecker turns that into seconds.

## Understanding eBay Sold Data: What the Numbers Mean

Not all eBay sold prices are created equal. Here's how to interpret the data.

### Average vs. Median

FlipChecker and manual analysis typically show average (mean) prices. But if there are outliers, the median (middle value) is more accurate.

**Example:**
Recent sold prices: $100, $105, $110, $115, $300 (outlier bundle)
- Average: $146
- Median: $110

The median better represents typical selling price in this case.

### Sold Listings vs. Active Listings

eBay's default search shows active listings (what sellers are asking). Always filter for sold listings (what buyers actually paid).

Active listings reflect seller optimism. Sold listings reflect market reality.

### Auction vs. Buy It Now

eBay sold data includes both auction-style and fixed-price sales. Auctions can end below market value (good for buyers) or above (bidding wars). Buy It Now prices are more stable.

If most sold listings are auctions, expect more price variance.

### International Sales

eBay sold listings include international sales. A $200 sale to Japan might not reflect what U.S. buyers will pay due to shipping costs and demand differences.

Filter by "Located in: United States" in advanced search for more relevant data.

## Interpreting Price Ranges for Smarter Buying

The price range tells you as much as the average.

**Narrow Range ($100-$115):**
- Stable market
- Condition has less impact
- Easy to price your listing
- Lower risk flip

**Wide Range ($50-$200):**
- Condition, completeness, or timing matters a lot
- Research further before buying
- Higher potential profit but more risk
- Make sure you know what differentiates the $200 sales from the $50 sales

**Example:**

Vintage Polaroid cameras show a wide range because:
- Working vs. non-working (huge price difference)
- Film included vs. body only
- Rare models vs. common models
- Cosmetic condition (collectors pay premiums for mint condition)

If the Facebook listing doesn't clearly state condition, ask questions before buying.

## Common Comparison Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Comparing Apples to Oranges**

A Facebook listing for "iPhone 12" could be 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB. Storage capacity affects eBay prices by $50-$100. Always match specs exactly.

**Mistake 2: Ignoring Seasonality**

Christmas decor in January shows low eBay sold prices. That doesn't mean it's a bad buy, it means you'll hold it until November. Plan for storage and cash flow accordingly.

**Mistake 3: Overlooking Shipping Costs**

Large, heavy, or fragile items eat into profits. A $300 eBay sold price sounds great until you realize the item weighs 50 pounds and costs $65 to ship safely.

**Mistake 4: Trusting One Data Point**

If eBay shows only 2 sold listings in 90 days, that's not reliable data. You need at least 8-10 sales to confidently estimate market value.

**Mistake 5: Forgetting About Competition**

Just because an item sold for $150 on eBay doesn't mean yours will. Check active listings. If there are 200 identical items listed, you'll compete on price and yours might sell for less.

## Advanced Price Comparison Strategies

**Strategy 1: Cross-Platform Validation**

Don't rely solely on eBay. Check:
- Mercari (sold listings visible if you create free account)
- WhatNot (live auction results)
- eBay completed listings (includes unsold items, shows what doesn't sell)

**Strategy 2: Time-Based Analysis**

Look at sold dates. Did 15 units sell in the past week or past 3 months? Fast sellers = quick flips and reliable pricing. Slow sellers = tie up capital longer.

**Strategy 3: Bundle Opportunity Identification**

Facebook listing shows a single item for $40. eBay sold data shows singles selling for $60, but bundles of 3 selling for $200.

Buy multiple similar items on Facebook, bundle them on eBay, and multiply your profit.

**Strategy 4: Condition Arbitrage**

Facebook sellers often undervalue items in good condition because they focus on defects. "Small scratch on back" drops a $200 item to $100 on Facebook, but eBay sold data shows scratched units still selling for $170.

Your profit comes from recognizing that buyers care less than sellers think.

## Combining Price Comparison with Market Research

Price comparison tells you what to pay. Market research tells you what to buy.

Use FlipChecker and eBay sold data to validate opportunities, but pair that with:

- **Category expertise:** Learn which brands, models, and eras hold value. Our guide to the [best items to flip](/blog/best-items-to-flip-on-facebook-marketplace-2026) breaks down profitable categories.

- **Trend awareness:** What's hot right now? Y2K fashion, vintage gaming, mid-century furniture. Ride trends while they last.

- **Local market knowledge:** Some cities have better Facebook Marketplace inventory than others. College towns in May (graduation) and wealthy suburbs year-round tend to have the best deals.

For deeper market research strategies, see our [Facebook Marketplace product research guide](/blog/facebook-marketplace-product-research).

## Using Price Data to Negotiate Better Deals

eBay sold data isn't just for deciding whether to buy. It's a negotiation tool.

**Negotiation Script Example:**

"Hi, I'm interested in the Sony headphones. I saw you're asking $120. I checked recent eBay sold listings and they're averaging $145-$165, but after fees and shipping I'd net about $130. Would you consider $95 so I can make a small profit reselling?"

**Why this works:**
- Shows you did research
- Demonstrates you're a serious buyer (not a lowballer)
- Explains your reasoning (reselling, not personal use)
- Offers fair value based on data

Most sellers respect transparency. You'll close more deals at better prices using data than making random low offers.
