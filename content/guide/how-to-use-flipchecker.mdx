# How to Use FlipChecker: Complete Tutorial

FlipChecker transforms Facebook Marketplace into a powerful sourcing platform by showing you real eBay sold prices directly on every listing. Whether you're a seasoned reseller or just starting out, this complete tutorial will walk you through every step of using FlipChecker to find profitable flips.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll know how to:
- Install and set up the FlipChecker Chrome extension
- Interpret the eBay price overlay on Facebook Marketplace
- Save promising deals to your dashboard
- Track your profit potential across multiple items
- Optimize your sourcing workflow for maximum efficiency

## Step 1: Install the FlipChecker Chrome Extension

Getting started with FlipChecker takes less than 60 seconds.

**Installation Process:**

1. Visit the Chrome Web Store and search for "FlipChecker" or navigate directly to flipchecker.io
2. Click "Add to Chrome" on the extension page
3. Confirm the installation by clicking "Add extension" in the popup
4. You'll see the FlipChecker icon appear in your Chrome toolbar

**Required Permissions:**

FlipChecker needs access to Facebook Marketplace pages to display the price overlay. The extension only activates on Facebook Marketplace URLs and never collects or sells your personal data.

## Step 2: Create Your FlipChecker Account

While you can browse with the extension immediately, creating an account unlocks the full power of FlipChecker.

**Sign Up Steps:**

1. Click the FlipChecker icon in your Chrome toolbar
2. Select "Sign Up" from the dropdown menu
3. Enter your email address or use Google Sign-In
4. Verify your email (check your spam folder if needed)
5. Choose your plan: Free (10 lookups/day) or Pro (unlimited)

**Free Tier Benefits:**

The free plan gives you 10 eBay price lookups per day with no credit card required. This is perfect for casual flippers or those testing the platform. You can upgrade to unlimited lookups anytime at [/auth/signup](/auth/signup).

## Step 3: Browse Facebook Marketplace with FlipChecker

Now for the magic. Open Facebook Marketplace and start browsing any category.

**What You'll See:**

As you scroll through listings, FlipChecker automatically adds a small overlay to each item showing:
- **Average eBay sold price** from the past 90 days
- **Price range** (lowest to highest recent sales)
- **Number of sold listings** found for comparison
- **Loading indicator** while data is being fetched

**Example in Action:**

Let's say you're browsing vintage cameras on Facebook Marketplace. You spot a Canon AE-1 listed for $75. Within 2 seconds, FlipChecker shows:

```
eBay Sold: $145 avg
Range: $110 - $180 (12 sales)
```

Instantly, you know this camera has sold for an average of $145 on eBay, with a typical range between $110 and $180. That's potential profit of $35-$70 after eBay fees, shipping, and your time.

## Step 4: Interpret the eBay Price Data

Understanding what the numbers mean is crucial to making smart buying decisions.

**Average Price:**

This is the mean of all matching eBay sold listings in the past 90 days. It gives you a quick benchmark, but always consider the range.

**Price Range:**

The lowest and highest sold prices show market volatility. A narrow range ($110-$130) means consistent demand and pricing. A wide range ($50-$200) suggests condition, bundling, or timing significantly impacts final sale price.

**Number of Sales:**

More sales = more reliable data. 15+ sales gives high confidence. 3-5 sales means you should do additional manual research on eBay to verify the opportunity.

**Red Flags to Watch For:**

- **Zero sales found:** The item may be too specific, misspelled, or genuinely rare
- **Wide price range with few sales:** Market is unpredictable or item condition varies dramatically
- **Average price below Facebook asking price:** Not necessarily a bad deal if you can negotiate down or add value through cleaning, bundling, or better photography

## Step 5: Save Deals to Your Dashboard

Found a promising flip? Save it for later analysis or to track your sourcing pipeline.

**How to Save a Deal:**

1. Click the FlipChecker overlay on any listing
2. Select "Save Deal" from the popup
3. Add optional notes (condition issues, negotiation strategy, etc.)
4. View all saved deals at flipchecker.io/dashboard

**Dashboard Features:**

Your FlipChecker dashboard organizes saved deals with:
- Thumbnail images and titles
- Facebook asking price vs. eBay average
- Estimated profit margin
- Date saved and status tags (watching, purchased, passed)
- Quick links back to the original Facebook listing

**Pro Tip:** Save items even if you're not ready to buy immediately. Deals disappear fast on Facebook Marketplace, but having them in your dashboard lets you message sellers quickly when you're ready.

## Step 6: Optimize Your Sourcing Workflow

With FlipChecker set up, here's how to maximize your efficiency and profit.

**Daily Sourcing Routine:**

1. **Morning Check (15 minutes):** Browse new listings in your top 3 categories with FlipChecker active. Save anything with 30%+ margin potential.
2. **Midday Follow-Up (10 minutes):** Message sellers on saved deals. Ask about condition, availability, and negotiate price.
3. **Evening Review (5 minutes):** Mark purchased items in dashboard, update profit tracking, archive passed deals.

**Advanced Techniques:**

**Multi-Category Scanning:** FlipChecker works across all Facebook Marketplace categories. Successful flippers typically focus on 2-4 categories where they have expertise (electronics, vintage clothing, sporting goods, furniture, etc.). Learn more in our [Facebook Marketplace flipping guide](/blog/facebook-marketplace-to-ebay-flipping-guide).

**Price Negotiation Strategy:** Use the eBay sold data as leverage. If a seller is asking $100 but FlipChecker shows an average of $80, you can negotiate knowing the market rate. Just be respectful and explain you're using recent sold data.

**Seasonal Opportunities:** Winter coats in March, Halloween decor in November, Christmas items in January. Off-season buying with FlipChecker helps you spot deep discounts that still have strong eBay demand.

## Step 7: Track Your Profits (Pro Feature)

Pro users get access to profit tracking that connects your Facebook purchases to eBay sales.

**How It Works:**

1. Mark items as "Purchased" in your dashboard with actual buy price
2. When you list on eBay, add the listing URL to FlipChecker
3. FlipChecker automatically tracks when the item sells
4. Your dashboard calculates total profit including fees and shipping

**Metrics You'll See:**

- Total revenue vs. cost of goods
- Average profit per item
- ROI percentage
- Best-performing categories
- Sourcing success rate (items bought vs. items saved)

This data helps you double down on what works and avoid categories with thin margins.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Trusting Price Data Blindly:**

Always click through to see the actual eBay sold listings. FlipChecker matches by title, but a "Canon AE-1" camera body sells for very different prices than a "Canon AE-1 with 50mm lens kit." Condition, completeness, and included accessories matter.

**Ignoring Shipping Costs:**

A $200 eBay sold price looks great until you realize it's a 40-pound item that costs $35 to ship. Factor in eBay's 13.25% final value fee plus shipping to calculate true profit. For detailed pricing strategy, see our [price comparison guide](/blog/compare-facebook-marketplace-prices-to-ebay).

**Forgetting About Competition:**

If FlipChecker shows strong eBay demand, other resellers likely see it too. On competitive items, message sellers within the first hour of listing to secure the deal.

## Integrating FlipChecker into Your Reselling Business

FlipChecker is most powerful when combined with other reselling best practices.

**Pair with Product Research:**

Use FlipChecker for quick price checks while browsing, then validate high-value opportunities with deeper research using [Facebook Marketplace product research](/blog/facebook-marketplace-product-research) strategies and eBay's sold listing filters.

**Combine with Inventory Tools:**

FlipChecker finds the deals. Inventory management software like List Perfectly or Vendoo helps you list faster and cross-post to multiple platforms.

**Learn Item Categories:**

The more you understand specific niches (vintage electronics, designer clothing, collectibles), the faster you'll spot underpriced gems. Check out our guide on the [best items to flip](/blog/best-items-to-flip-on-facebook-marketplace-2026) to start building expertise.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**No eBay Data Showing:**

- Check that you're on facebook.com/marketplace (not a saved or shared link)
- Refresh the page to reload the extension
- Verify you haven't exceeded daily lookup limits on the free plan
- Try clicking the listing to open detail view, sometimes data loads on the individual page

**Inaccurate Price Matches:**

If FlipChecker is pulling unrelated eBay sold data, the Facebook listing title might be too generic or contain extra keywords. Manually search eBay sold listings using more specific terms from the item description.

**Extension Not Loading:**

- Disable other extensions temporarily to check for conflicts
- Clear your browser cache and reload Facebook Marketplace
- Ensure FlipChecker is enabled in chrome://extensions
- Try reinstalling the extension if issues persist
