When building an arbitrage business, choosing the right scanning and analysis tool determines how quickly you can find profitable products. SellerAmp and FlipChecker are both popular arbitrage tools, but they're designed for completely different business models. This detailed comparison will help you choose the right tool for your specific arbitrage strategy.

## What Is SellerAmp?

SellerAmp (formerly SellerAmp SAS) is a mobile app designed for Amazon FBA arbitrage. It allows sellers to scan product barcodes or search ASINs while shopping in retail stores, instantly providing profitability calculations, sales rank data, competitor analysis, and FBA fee estimates.

SellerAmp helps Amazon sellers make fast buying decisions in stores by showing whether a product will be profitable after all Amazon fees, shipping costs, and competition factors are considered. It's particularly popular for retail arbitrage and online arbitrage to Amazon FBA.

## What Is FlipChecker?

FlipChecker is a Chrome extension and web app built specifically for Facebook Marketplace to eBay arbitrage. It automatically displays real-time eBay sold listing prices directly on Facebook Marketplace listings as you browse, eliminating the need for manual research.

Unlike scanning tools, FlipChecker works passively in the background, analyzing every Facebook Marketplace listing you view and instantly showing profit potential without requiring any scans or searches.

## Core Feature Comparison

| Feature | SellerAmp SAS | FlipChecker |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Primary Platform | Amazon FBA | Facebook Marketplace → eBay |
| Sourcing Method | Retail/online arbitrage | Facebook Marketplace sourcing |
| Input Method | Barcode/ASIN scanning | Automatic browser overlay |
| Device | Mobile app (iOS/Android) | Chrome extension (desktop) |
| Data Provided | FBA fees, sales rank, ROI | eBay sold prices, profit margin |
| Learning Curve | Low to moderate | Minimal |
| Best For | In-store retail arbitrage | Online local arbitrage |
| Pricing | $16.63/month | Free tier, $19-39/month |

## Target Marketplace Differences

The fundamental difference between these tools is the marketplace ecosystem they serve.

### SellerAmp: Amazon FBA Ecosystem

SellerAmp is built exclusively for sellers who want to sell on Amazon using Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA). It provides:

- Real-time Amazon sales rank data
- FBA fee calculations
- Profit margin calculations after all Amazon fees
- Competitor pricing analysis
- Restricted product warnings
- Historical price charts
- IP alert notifications

If you're not selling on Amazon FBA, SellerAmp provides no value.

### FlipChecker: Facebook Marketplace to eBay

FlipChecker connects the Facebook Marketplace sourcing ecosystem to eBay selling. It helps you:

- See eBay sold prices for Facebook Marketplace items
- Calculate profit before buying locally
- Make instant decisions while browsing from home
- Identify underpriced items automatically
- Avoid unprofitable purchases

FlipChecker is purpose-built for the [Facebook Marketplace to eBay flipping](/blog/facebook-marketplace-to-ebay-flipping-guide) business model and doesn't work with Amazon at all.

## Sourcing Workflow Comparison

### SellerAmp Workflow

1. Visit retail stores (Target, Walmart, HomeGoods, etc.)
2. Scan product barcodes with SellerAmp mobile app
3. Review instant profitability analysis
4. Check sales rank and competition
5. Purchase profitable items
6. Ship to Amazon FBA warehouses
7. Amazon handles storage, shipping, and customer service

This workflow requires physically visiting stores, scanning numerous products, and managing FBA inventory.

### FlipChecker Workflow

1. Browse Facebook Marketplace from home
2. FlipChecker automatically analyzes each listing
3. See instant eBay sold prices overlaid
4. Calculate profit potential in seconds
5. Contact seller and arrange pickup
6. List on eBay and ship when sold

This workflow is entirely online (except for local pickup), requires no scanning, and works from your computer. The [how to use FlipChecker](/guide/how-to-use-flipchecker) guide shows how streamlined this process is.

## Pricing Breakdown

### SellerAmp Pricing

SellerAmp offers a single subscription tier:

- **SellerAmp SAS**: $16.63/month (billed annually at $199.99/year)
- Includes unlimited scans
- Mobile app for iOS and Android
- All features included in one price

The annual billing requirement means you need to commit upfront, though the monthly cost is competitive.

### FlipChecker Pricing

FlipChecker provides flexible options:

- **Free Tier**: 10 lookups/day, no credit card required
- **Flipper Plan**: $19/month for 100 lookups/day
- **Pro Plan**: $39/month for 500 lookups/day with real eBay sold data

FlipChecker's free tier lets you test the platform without any financial commitment, making it easier for beginners to get started.

## Product Categories and Inventory Approach

### SellerAmp Product Categories

SellerAmp works best for:
- Branded retail products with ASINs
- Clearance items from major retailers
- Books, toys, health & beauty products
- Seasonal items at discount stores
- Online arbitrage from retail websites

These are typically new, branded products that already exist on Amazon's catalog.

### FlipChecker Product Categories

FlipChecker excels with:
- Used or vintage items commonly found on Facebook Marketplace
- Electronics, furniture, sporting goods
- Collectibles and unique finds
- Local pickup items
- Items from our guide to [best items to flip on Facebook Marketplace 2026](/blog/best-items-to-flip-on-facebook-marketplace-2026)

These are often one-of-a-kind or used items that require individual eBay listings.

## Time Investment and Scalability

### SellerAmp Scalability

SellerAmp requires:
- Time spent physically visiting stores
- Gas and vehicle wear for sourcing trips
- Prep time for FBA shipments
- Managing inventory at Amazon warehouses

However, once products reach FBA, Amazon handles fulfillment, making it more passive on the back end.

### FlipChecker Scalability

FlipChecker requires:
- Time browsing Facebook Marketplace (can be done from anywhere)
- Communication with local sellers
- Local pickup trips
- Individual eBay listing creation and shipping

The sourcing is more convenient (from home), but each item requires individual shipping after sale.

Both models have different scaling characteristics, and neither is objectively better—it depends on your lifestyle and preferences.

## Fees and Profit Margins

### SellerAmp/Amazon FBA Fees

When using SellerAmp for Amazon arbitrage, you pay:
- Amazon referral fees (typically 15%)
- FBA fulfillment fees ($3-10+ per item depending on size)
- Storage fees (monthly)
- Potential long-term storage fees
- Return processing fees

SellerAmp calculates all these fees automatically, showing your net profit after expenses.

### FlipChecker/eBay Fees

When using FlipChecker for eBay arbitrage, you pay:
- eBay final value fees (typically 12.9% + $0.30)
- PayPal or Managed Payments fees (if applicable)
- Shipping costs (typically passed to buyer)
- Listing fees (for premium features)

FlipChecker shows eBay sold prices, allowing you to calculate profit margins manually or use eBay's profit calculator.

Amazon FBA fees are generally higher but include fulfillment. eBay fees are lower but require self-fulfillment.

## Mobile vs Desktop Experience

**SellerAmp** is primarily a mobile app, designed for on-the-go scanning in retail stores. The mobile-first approach makes sense for retail arbitrage where you need portability.

**FlipChecker** works as a Chrome extension on desktop, which is ideal for browsing Facebook Marketplace where you can efficiently view dozens of listings side-by-side on a larger screen.

The device differences reflect the different sourcing methods each tool supports.

## Data Accuracy and Reliability

### SellerAmp Data

SellerAmp pulls data directly from Amazon's API, providing:
- Real-time sales rank
- Current Amazon prices
- FBA fee calculations
- Competitor counts
- Historical price data

This data is highly accurate because it comes directly from Amazon's platform.

### FlipChecker Data

FlipChecker focuses on real eBay sold listings (especially in the Pro tier), showing what items actually sold for rather than asking prices. This is critical for accurate profit projections.

For effective [Facebook Marketplace product research](/blog/facebook-marketplace-product-research), sold data provides the most reliable profit estimates.

## Learning Curve and Ease of Use

### SellerAmp Learning Curve

SellerAmp requires understanding:
- What sales rank numbers mean
- How to interpret FBA fees
- What ROI percentages are acceptable
- How to evaluate competition levels
- When to account for prep costs

Most users become proficient within a few sourcing trips, but there's definitely a learning period.

### FlipChecker Learning Curve

FlipChecker is designed to be immediately intuitive:
- Install the Chrome extension
- Browse Facebook Marketplace normally
- See profit potential instantly displayed
- Make buy/no-buy decisions without additional research

Most users are productive within minutes, making it ideal for beginners following our [Facebook Marketplace flipping for beginners](/guide/facebook-marketplace-flipping-for-beginners) guide.

## Can You Use Both Tools Together?

Yes, but only if you're running both Amazon FBA and eBay businesses simultaneously.

**Use both if you're:**
- Selling on both Amazon and eBay
- Diversifying across multiple marketplaces
- Building a full-time reselling business with multiple revenue streams

**You probably only need one if:**
- You're focused on mastering one marketplace first
- You're starting part-time with limited capital
- Your local market favors one sourcing method over the other

Most successful resellers specialize in one platform initially, then potentially expand later.

## Geographic and Market Considerations

### SellerAmp Geographic Factors

SellerAmp's effectiveness depends on:
- Proximity to retail stores with good clearance sections
- Local competition from other Amazon arbitrage sellers
- Regional pricing differences at national retailers
- Store policies on resellers (some stores restrict or ban resellers)

Urban and suburban areas with multiple retail options work best.

### FlipChecker Geographic Factors

FlipChecker's effectiveness depends on:
- Size and activity of your local Facebook Marketplace
- Population density (more people = more listings)
- Local wealth levels (affects item quality and variety)
- Distance you're willing to travel for pickups

Both urban and suburban areas can work well, as can smaller towns with active Facebook Marketplace communities.

## Business Model Comparison

### Amazon FBA with SellerAmp

**Pros:**
- Amazon handles storage, shipping, and customer service
- Access to Amazon Prime customers
- Passive fulfillment after initial prep
- Scalable without warehouse space

**Cons:**
- Higher fees cut into margins
- Inventory risk (items may not sell)
- Requires retail store access
- Competition from other FBA sellers
- Potential for account suspensions

### eBay with FlipChecker

**Pros:**
- Lower marketplace fees
- No inventory storage fees
- Source from home
- Often less competition on unique items
- More control over customer experience

**Cons:**
- Self-fulfillment required
- Individual shipping for each sale
- No passive fulfillment
- Building feedback takes time

Both business models are proven and profitable—the best choice depends on your lifestyle, capital, and preferences.
