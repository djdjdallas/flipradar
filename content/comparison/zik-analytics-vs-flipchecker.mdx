## Workflow Differences

### The Zik Analytics Workflow

Using Zik Analytics requires a research-first approach:

1. Log into the Zik Analytics dashboard
2. Enter product keywords or categories
3. Analyze market data, competition, and trends
4. Identify profitable product opportunities
5. Source products based on your research

6. Move on to the next listing

This workflow is faster and more intuitive, especially for resellers who want to source during downtime or on mobile devices.

## Data Quality and Accuracy

Both tools provide reliable data, but from different sources:

**Zik Analytics** pulls comprehensive data directly from eBay's marketplace, including active listings, sold listings, and historical trends. The data is extensive and well-suited for long-term market analysis.

**FlipChecker** focuses on real eBay sold listings (especially in the Pro plan), which represent actual market prices rather than asking prices. This is crucial for accurate profit calculations when flipping from Facebook Marketplace.

For resellers focusing on [Facebook Marketplace product research](/blog/facebook-marketplace-product-research), FlipChecker's sold listing data provides the most relevant information for arbitrage decisions.

## Can You Use Both Tools Together?

- **FlipChecker for sourcing**: Find profitable items on Facebook Marketplace quickly
- **Zik Analytics for optimization**: Research how to best list and price those items on eBay

This combination gives you the best of both worlds: efficient sourcing and data-driven listing optimization. You can discover opportunities with FlipChecker, then use Zik Analytics to understand competitive positioning and seasonal trends.

## Integration and Ease of Use

**Zik Analytics** requires logging into a web dashboard and actively conducting research. There's a learning curve to understanding the various metrics and making the most of the platform's features.

**FlipChecker** works as a browser extension that requires minimal setup. Once installed, it works automatically, making it accessible even for non-technical users. The [how to use FlipChecker guide](/guide/how-to-use-flipchecker) covers everything in under five minutes.
