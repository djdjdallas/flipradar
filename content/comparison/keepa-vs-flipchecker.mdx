Choosing the right price tracking tool is critical for profitable reselling, but not all tools work across all platforms. Keepa and FlipChecker are both powerful tools for resellers, but they operate in completely different ecosystems. This comparison will help you understand which tool you need based on your sourcing strategy.

## What Is Keepa?

Keepa is the industry-standard price tracking tool for Amazon sellers and buyers. It tracks historical price data for millions of Amazon products, showing price trends over time through detailed charts and graphs. Keepa helps users identify price drops, track deals, set price alerts, and analyze sales rank history.

Keepa is essential for Amazon arbitrage sellers who need to understand product price history, seasonal trends, and whether current prices represent good buying opportunities. The tool integrates directly into Amazon product pages through a browser extension and also offers a standalone website and API.

## What Is FlipChecker?

FlipChecker is a Chrome extension and web app designed specifically for Facebook Marketplace to eBay arbitrage. It shows real-time eBay sold listing prices directly overlaid on Facebook Marketplace listings, helping resellers instantly assess profit potential without manual research.

Unlike price tracking tools, FlipChecker provides instant market comparisons as you browse, eliminating the need to manually search eBay for every Facebook Marketplace item you encounter.

## Core Feature Comparison

| Feature | Keepa | FlipChecker |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Primary Platform | Amazon | Facebook Marketplace → eBay |
| Main Function | Price history tracking | Real-time price comparison |
| Data Visualization | Historical price charts | Instant sold price overlays |
| Browser Extension | Yes (Amazon integration) | Yes (Facebook Marketplace integration) |
| Price Alerts | Yes | No (instant analysis instead) |
| Historical Data | Years of price history | Recent sold listings |
| Best For | Amazon arbitrage & tracking | Facebook Marketplace sourcing |
| Learning Curve | Moderate (chart interpretation) | Minimal (instant readability) |

## Marketplace Ecosystem Differences

The most fundamental difference between Keepa and FlipChecker is the marketplace ecosystem they serve.

### Keepa: Amazon Ecosystem

Keepa exclusively tracks Amazon data. It monitors:

- Amazon product prices across all regions
- Third-party seller prices
- Amazon's own prices (when applicable)
- Sales rank history
- Price drops and increases
- Buy Box statistics

If you're not sourcing for Amazon or buying from Amazon, Keepa provides no value. It cannot track Facebook Marketplace, eBay, or any other platform.

### FlipChecker: Facebook Marketplace to eBay

FlipChecker bridges the gap between Facebook Marketplace and eBay. It helps you:

- See what Facebook Marketplace items sold for on eBay
- Calculate profit potential before buying
- Make instant decisions while browsing
- Identify arbitrage opportunities automatically

FlipChecker is built specifically for the [Facebook Marketplace to eBay flipping](/blog/facebook-marketplace-to-ebay-flipping-guide) workflow and doesn't work with Amazon at all.

## Pricing Comparison

### Keepa Pricing

Keepa offers:

- **Free tier**: Basic price history charts on Amazon product pages
- **Premium subscription**: €19/month (~$20 USD) for full features including sales rank data, detailed charts, price drop notifications, and data exports

The premium subscription is considered essential for serious Amazon arbitrage sellers who need complete market intelligence.

### FlipChecker Pricing

FlipChecker provides:

- **Free tier**: 10 lookups/day, no credit card required
- **Flipper Plan**: $19/month for 100 lookups/day
- **Pro Plan**: $39/month for 500 lookups/day with real eBay sold data

FlipChecker's free tier offers more functional value than Keepa's free tier for Facebook Marketplace flippers, making it easy to test the platform risk-free.

## Use Cases: When to Use Each Tool

### When Keepa Is Essential

Use Keepa when you're:

- Doing retail arbitrage from physical stores to Amazon
- Conducting online arbitrage to Amazon FBA
- Buying products for personal use and want to track prices
- Analyzing Amazon private label opportunities
- Tracking competitor pricing on Amazon
- Setting up automated price drop alerts for wholesale purchasing

Keepa is indispensable if Amazon is part of your business model, either as a selling platform or sourcing platform.

### When FlipChecker Is Essential

Use FlipChecker when you're:

- Sourcing from Facebook Marketplace for eBay resale
- Following strategies from our [Facebook Marketplace flipping for beginners](/guide/facebook-marketplace-flipping-for-beginners) guide
- Looking for local pickup arbitrage opportunities
- Wanting to quickly assess hundreds of Facebook Marketplace listings
- Focusing on the [best items to flip on Facebook Marketplace](/blog/best-items-to-flip-on-facebook-marketplace-2026)

If Facebook Marketplace is your primary sourcing platform and eBay is your selling platform, FlipChecker provides the market intelligence you need.

## Data Accuracy and Reliability

### Keepa's Data

Keepa has tracked Amazon prices since 2011, providing over a decade of historical data for millions of products. The data is highly reliable because it's pulled directly from Amazon's platform multiple times per day.

Keepa's charts show:
- All-time price highs and lows
- Seasonal price patterns
- Stock availability history
- Sales rank fluctuations

This historical context is invaluable for understanding Amazon market dynamics.

### FlipChecker's Data

FlipChecker focuses on recent eBay sold listings, which represent actual transaction prices rather than asking prices. This is critical for accurate profit calculations.

The Pro tier provides real eBay sold data, ensuring you're seeing what items actually sold for, not just what sellers are asking. This accuracy is essential for making profitable buying decisions on Facebook Marketplace.

For effective [Facebook Marketplace product research](/blog/facebook-marketplace-product-research), sold data beats historical trends because Facebook Marketplace items are typically unique or one-off finds.

## Workflow Integration

### The Keepa Workflow

1. Browse Amazon or retail stores
2. Check Keepa price history for products you find
3. Analyze price trends and sales rank
4. Decide whether current price is good
5. Purchase if profitable
6. List on Amazon FBA or FBM

This workflow requires understanding chart patterns and making decisions based on historical trends.

### The FlipChecker Workflow

1. Browse Facebook Marketplace normally
2. FlipChecker automatically shows eBay sold prices
3. See instant profit calculations
4. Make buy/no-buy decision in seconds
5. Purchase directly from seller
6. List on eBay

This workflow is more streamlined because FlipChecker works passively as you browse, requiring no additional clicks or research steps. The [how to use FlipChecker](/guide/how-to-use-flipchecker) guide shows how simple the process is.

## Mobile Experience

**Keepa** offers a mobile app and mobile-responsive website, allowing you to track prices and set alerts from your phone. However, the chart-heavy interface can be challenging on smaller screens.

**FlipChecker** currently works as a Chrome extension on desktop, which is ideal since most serious Facebook Marketplace sourcing happens on larger screens where you can efficiently browse multiple listings.

## Learning Curve

### Keepa's Learning Curve

Keepa requires understanding:
- How to interpret price history charts
- What sales rank means and how it correlates with velocity
- How to spot seasonal patterns
- When price drops are temporary vs. permanent
- How to set effective price alerts

This takes time to master, especially for beginners new to Amazon selling.

### FlipChecker's Learning Curve

FlipChecker is designed to be immediately intuitive:
- Install the extension
- Browse Facebook Marketplace
- See profit potential instantly
- Make decisions without additional research

Most users are productive within minutes of installation, making it ideal for beginners following our [best Chrome extensions for Facebook Marketplace resellers](/blog/best-chrome-extensions-for-facebook-marketplace-resellers) recommendations.

## Can You Use Both Tools?

Yes, but only if you're running multiple business models simultaneously.

**Use both if you're:**
- Doing both Amazon FBA and eBay flipping
- Sourcing from both online/retail stores for Amazon and Facebook Marketplace for eBay
- Running a diversified reselling business across multiple platforms

**You probably only need one if:**
- You're focused on a single marketplace (Amazon OR eBay)
- You're just starting and want to master one platform first
- Your sourcing strategy focuses on one primary channel

Most resellers specialize in one marketplace ecosystem and only need the corresponding tool.

## Alternative Arbitrage Models

## Product Categories: Where Each Tool Shines

### Keepa Strengths

Keepa works best for:
- Branded products with consistent Amazon presence
- Books, media, and electronics with clear ASINs
- Products with price fluctuations over time
- Seasonal items with predictable patterns
- Private label research

### FlipChecker Strengths

FlipChecker excels with:
- Unique or vintage items commonly found on Facebook Marketplace
- Local pickup items (furniture, appliances, sporting goods)
- Collectibles and one-off finds
- Items from our [best items to flip Facebook Marketplace to eBay](/blog/best-items-to-flip-facebook-marketplace-to-ebay) guide

The product categories naturally align with the sourcing platforms each tool supports.

## Which Tool Should You Choose?

The decision is actually straightforward:

**Choose Keepa if:**
- You sell on Amazon (FBA or FBM)
- You source from retail stores or online retailers for Amazon
- You need to track Amazon price history
- You're doing Amazon private label research
- Amazon is your primary or secondary marketplace

**Choose FlipChecker if:**
- You source from Facebook Marketplace
- You sell primarily on eBay
- You want instant profit calculations without manual research
- You prefer local pickup sourcing
- You're following Facebook Marketplace to eBay arbitrage strategies

**You might need both if:**
- You're running separate Amazon and eBay businesses
- You source from multiple channels for different marketplaces
- You have the budget and time to manage multiple platforms

## Getting Started with the Right Tool

For most resellers, the choice is determined by your selling platform:

- **Amazon sellers need Keepa**
- **eBay flippers sourcing from Facebook Marketplace need FlipChecker**

If you're just starting out and exploring which marketplace to focus on, FlipChecker's free tier offers an excellent way to test Facebook Marketplace to eBay flipping without any financial commitment.

[Sign up for FlipChecker](/auth/signup) and get 10 free lookups per day to see if Facebook Marketplace arbitrage works for your business model. No credit card required.

## Data-Driven Decision Making

Both tools emphasize data-driven decisions, but in different ways:

**Keepa** provides historical context to help you understand price patterns and make informed buying decisions based on trends.

**FlipChecker** provides instant market comparisons to help you make fast buying decisions based on current sold data.

For Facebook Marketplace flipping, speed matters more than historical trends because items are often one-of-a-kind and sell quickly. This is where FlipChecker's instant analysis provides a significant advantage over manual research methods.

## Analyzing eBay Sold Listings

While Keepa focuses on Amazon, understanding [eBay sold listings for Facebook Marketplace analysis](/blog/ebay-sold-listings-facebook-marketplace-analysis) is crucial for Facebook Marketplace flippers. FlipChecker automates this entire process, eliminating the tedious manual searches that would otherwise be required.

## Conclusion

Keepa and FlipChecker aren't really competitors because they serve completely different marketplaces and business models. Keepa is essential for Amazon sellers and buyers, while FlipChecker is purpose-built for Facebook Marketplace to eBay arbitrage.

The right choice depends entirely on your marketplace focus:

- If you're selling on Amazon, Keepa is non-negotiable
- If you're flipping from Facebook Marketplace to eBay, FlipChecker is the clear winner
- If you're doing both, you might benefit from both tools

For resellers specifically focused on Facebook Marketplace sourcing, FlipChecker provides immediate value that no Amazon-focused tool can match. Start with the free tier today and experience how automated price checking transforms your Facebook Marketplace browsing into a profit-finding machine.
