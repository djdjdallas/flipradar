faqs:
  - question: "Is Facebook Marketplace to eBay flipping easier than Amazon arbitrage?"

  - question: "Can I use FlipChecker if I already sell on Amazon?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Many resellers use FlipChecker to source profitable items from Facebook Marketplace and sell on multiple platforms including eBay, Amazon, and Mercari. It's a sourcing tool, not platform-specific."
  - question: "Do I need special software to sell items I find with FlipChecker?"

# FlipChecker: The Alternative to Amazon-Only Arbitrage Tools

Amazon FBA arbitrage dominated the reselling conversation for years. Tools like Tactical Arbitrage, SourceMogul, and Keepa built entire businesses around finding products to buy low and sell on Amazon.

But the Amazon arbitrage game has changed. Higher fees, more competition, restrictive gating policies, and saturated niches mean the easy money is gone.

FlipChecker represents a different arbitrage model: Facebook Marketplace to eBay. Lower barriers to entry, less competition, no inventory fees, and faster cash flow.

This guide compares FlipChecker's peer-to-peer marketplace approach to traditional Amazon arbitrage tools and explains why many resellers are shifting strategies.

## The Amazon Arbitrage Model: How It Works

Amazon arbitrage involves buying products from one source (retail stores, online retailers, or liquidation sites) and reselling them on Amazon at a higher price.

**Common Amazon Arbitrage Sources:**

- **Retail Arbitrage:** Buy clearance items at Walmart, Target, CVS, then resell on Amazon
- **Online Arbitrage:** Find deals on other websites, buy bulk, ship to Amazon FBA
- **Wholesale:** Purchase directly from distributors at wholesale prices
- **Liquidation:** Buy pallets of returned/overstock items, resell individually

**Tools Used:**

- **Tactical Arbitrage:** Scans online retailers for price discrepancies
- **SourceMogul:** Automated deal finding across multiple sites
- **Keepa:** Amazon price history and tracking
- **Scoutify/InventoryLab:** In-store barcode scanning for retail arbitrage

**Profit Model:**

Buy a product for $15, sell on Amazon for $35. Amazon FBA handles storage, shipping, and customer service. You keep the difference minus Amazon fees (typically 15-30% total), storage costs, and inbound shipping.

## Why Amazon Arbitrage Has Become Harder

**1. Rising Fees**

Amazon's FBA fees have increased nearly every year. The current fee structure includes:
- **Referral fee:** 15% on most categories
- **FBA fulfillment fee:** $3-8 per item depending on size/weight
- **Storage fees:** Monthly charges based on cubic footage
- **Long-term storage:** Additional fees for inventory sitting 181+ days
- **Removal/disposal fees:** If items don't sell

**Real Example:**

You buy a $10 item, sell it for $25 on Amazon.
- Referral fee (15%): $3.75
- FBA fulfillment: $4.50
- Storage (2 months): $0.80
- Total fees: $9.05
- Net profit: $25 - $10 - $9.05 = $5.95

That's a 23.8% ROI, but only if the item sells quickly.

**2. Increased Competition**

Every retail clearance section has multiple arbitrage sellers scanning barcodes. Online arbitrage tools scrape the same deals for thousands of users. The race to the bottom means thinner margins.

**3. Gating and Restrictions**

Amazon restricts selling in many profitable categories (toys, grocery, health & beauty) unless you apply for approval. Even approved sellers face brand restrictions, requiring invoices from authorized distributors.

**4. IP Complaints**

Brands increasingly police Amazon for unauthorized resellers. One intellectual property complaint can suspend your account, freeze your funds, and end your business.

**5. Cash Flow Delays**

Amazon holds payments for 14 days (or longer for new sellers). You buy inventory upfront, wait for it to sell, then wait another 2 weeks to get paid. This ties up capital and limits growth.

## The FlipChecker Model: Facebook Marketplace to eBay

FlipChecker takes a completely different approach: peer-to-peer marketplace arbitrage.

**How It Works:**

1. Browse Facebook Marketplace for local items (used and new)
2. FlipChecker shows real eBay sold prices directly on each listing
3. Identify items priced below market value
4. Buy locally with cash (no upfront inventory risk)
5. List on eBay, Mercari, or other platforms
6. Ship directly to buyer when item sells

**Profit Model:**

Buy a Nintendo Switch for $150 on Facebook Marketplace. FlipChecker shows average eBay sold price of $240. List on eBay for $235. After eBay fees (13.25%) and shipping ($12), net profit is approximately $42.

## FlipChecker vs. Amazon Arbitrage Tools: Direct Comparison

### Sourcing Method

**Amazon Tools (Tactical Arbitrage, SourceMogul):**
- Scan online retailers and retail stores
- Compete with thousands of other sellers using the same tools
- Deals disappear within hours as tools alert everyone simultaneously

**FlipChecker:**
- Source from local Facebook Marketplace sellers
- Unique inventory in your geographic area
- Less competition because most resellers focus on retail/online arbitrage

**Winner:** FlipChecker for unique inventory and lower competition

### Upfront Investment

**Amazon Arbitrage:**
- Buy inventory in bulk to hit price breaks and justify shipping costs
- Typical investment: $500-2,000 per order
- Capital tied up until items sell (often 30-90 days)

**FlipChecker:**
- Buy one item at a time with cash
- Typical investment: $20-100 per item
- Sell before buying more (infinite inventory turnover)

**Winner:** FlipChecker for low barrier to entry and cash flow flexibility

### Fees and Costs

**Amazon FBA:**
- 15% referral fee
- $3-8 fulfillment fee per item
- Monthly storage fees
- Inbound shipping costs
- Total: 25-35% of sale price

**eBay (FlipChecker model):**
- 13.25% final value fee (includes payment processing)
- Shipping costs (passed to buyer or built into price)
- No storage fees (you hold inventory at home)
- Total: 13-20% of sale price depending on shipping strategy

**Winner:** FlipChecker (eBay model) for lower total fees

### Time to Profit

**Amazon Arbitrage:**
- Buy inventory → Ship to Amazon → Wait for Amazon to receive and process → Item sells → Amazon holds payment 14 days
- Total time: 21-45 days from purchase to cash

**FlipChecker:**
- Buy item locally → List same day → Item sells → PayPal/eBay payment immediately
- Total time: 3-14 days from purchase to cash

**Winner:** FlipChecker for faster cash flow

### Scalability

**Amazon FBA:**
- Highly scalable with automation
- Source thousands of units, ship to Amazon, let FBA handle fulfillment
- Can build to 6-7 figure revenue with systems

**FlipChecker:**
- Scalable but labor-intensive
- Limited by local inventory and your ability to list/ship items
- Typically maxes out at $3,000-10,000/month per person without hiring

**Winner:** Amazon for high-volume scaling, FlipChecker for sustainable solo income

### Risk Level

**Amazon Arbitrage:**
- Account suspension risk (IP complaints, policy violations)
- Inventory risk (items don't sell, long-term storage fees)
- Cash flow risk (capital tied up in slow-moving inventory)
- Platform dependency (Amazon changes rules constantly)

**FlipChecker:**
- Lower inventory risk (buy one item at a time)
- No account suspension risk (eBay is reseller-friendly)
- Lower capital risk (small per-item investment)
- Platform diversification (can sell on eBay, Mercari, Poshmark, etc.)

**Winner:** FlipChecker for lower overall risk

### Learning Curve

**Amazon Arbitrage:**
- Complex fee structure
- FBA shipping requirements (labeling, prep, box sizes)
- Category restrictions and approval processes
- Tax complexity (sales tax, inventory accounting)

**FlipChecker:**
- Simple buy low, sell high model
- List items like any eBay seller
- No special shipping requirements (USPS, UPS, FedEx all work)
- Easier tax reporting (fewer transactions, simple cost basis)

**Winner:** FlipChecker for beginner-friendliness

## When Amazon Arbitrage Still Makes Sense

FlipChecker isn't for everyone. Amazon arbitrage has advantages in specific scenarios:

**Choose Amazon arbitrage if you:**
- Have significant starting capital ($5,000+)
- Want to build a hands-off business (FBA handles fulfillment)
- Prefer buying bulk inventory over one-off deals
- Have access to wholesale or liquidation sources
- Are comfortable with complex business operations

**Choose FlipChecker if you:**
- Have limited starting capital ($100-500)
- Want flexible, part-time income without major commitments
- Prefer low-risk, incremental growth
- Live in an area with active Facebook Marketplace inventory
- Value simplicity and direct control over inventory

## Real Profit Comparison: Amazon vs. FlipChecker

Let's compare two resellers with $500 starting capital over one month.

### Amazon Arbitrage Seller

**Investment:** $500 in clearance items from retail stores using Tactical Arbitrage

**Items Purchased:**
- 25 items averaging $20 cost each
- Average Amazon selling price: $40
- Average total fees (30%): $12 per item

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Source and ship to Amazon FBA
- Week 2: Amazon receives and lists items
- Week 3-4: Items begin selling (60% sell in first month = 15 items)

**Results After 30 Days:**
- Revenue: 15 items × $40 = $600
- COGS: 15 items × $20 = $300
- Fees: 15 items × $12 = $180
- Net Profit: $600 - $300 - $180 = $120

**ROI:** 24% monthly (but 10 items still unsold, capital still tied up)

**Cash in hand:** $0 (Amazon holds payment for 14 days, so first payout comes on day 35-40)

### FlipChecker Seller

**Investment:** $500 rolling capital for Facebook Marketplace buys

**Items Purchased:**
- 15 items averaging $33 cost each (bought over 4 weeks as budget allows)
- Average eBay selling price: $65
- Average eBay fees (13.25%): $8.61 per item
- Average shipping cost: $8

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Buy 4 items, list same day, 2 sell within 7 days
- Week 2: Buy 3 more items with profit from week 1 sales, 3 sell
- Week 3: Buy 4 more items, 3 sell
- Week 4: Buy 4 more items, 3 sell

**Results After 30 Days:**
- Revenue: 11 items sold × $65 = $715
- COGS: 11 items × $33 = $363
- Fees: 11 items × $8.61 = $94.71
- Shipping: 11 items × $8 = $88
- Net Profit: $715 - $363 - $94.71 - $88 = $169.29

**ROI:** 33.9% monthly

**Cash in hand:** $169.29 (available immediately via PayPal)

**Winner:** FlipChecker for higher profit, better cash flow, and lower risk in this scenario

## Combining Both Strategies

You don't have to choose one or the other. Many successful resellers use both models strategically.

**Hybrid Approach:**

- **Use FlipChecker** for weekly cash flow and low-risk inventory
- **Use Amazon FBA** for bulk deals and hands-off passive income
- **Cross-list** high-value items on both eBay and Amazon for maximum exposure

**Example Workflow:**

Monday-Friday: Spend 30 minutes daily browsing Facebook Marketplace with FlipChecker. Buy 1-2 profitable items per day, list on eBay, ship as they sell.

Weekends: Visit retail stores for clearance arbitrage. Buy bulk, prep for Amazon FBA, ship once per month.

This hybrid model provides consistent weekly income (FlipChecker/eBay) and scalable passive revenue (Amazon FBA).

## Why Facebook Marketplace Sourcing Has Less Competition

**1. Local Nature**

Facebook Marketplace is hyperlocal. You're competing with buyers in your city, not nationally. Amazon arbitrage tools scan the same national retailers, so you're competing with sellers nationwide.

**2. No Automation**

You can't easily automate Facebook Marketplace sourcing. You have to browse manually (with FlipChecker speeding up price research). Amazon arbitrage tools run 24/7 automated scans, creating intense competition.

**3. Seller Ignorance**

Many Facebook Marketplace sellers don't research prices. They list based on gut feeling or what they paid originally. Amazon/retail clearance is already priced strategically.

**4. Relationship Factor**

Facebook Marketplace involves meeting people, building rapport, and negotiating. This human element filters out lazy arbitrage sellers who prefer clicking "buy" on websites.

## Tools You Need for Each Model

### Amazon Arbitrage Toolkit

**Required:**
- Tactical Arbitrage or SourceMogul ($40-100/month)
- Keepa ($19/month)
- InventoryLab or similar inventory management ($50/month)
- Amazon Seller account ($39.99/month)
- UPC barcodes and labeling supplies
- Shipping scale and thermal printer

**Total Monthly Cost:** $150-200 plus Amazon fees

### FlipChecker Toolkit

**Required:**
- FlipChecker ($0-19/month depending on plan)
- eBay seller account (free, fees per sale)
- Shipping scale ($20 one-time)
- Shipping supplies ($20-50/month)

**Optional:**
- List Perfectly or Vendoo for cross-listing ($20-30/month)
- Grammarly for professional FB Marketplace messaging ($12/month)

**Total Monthly Cost:** $20-60 depending on features

**Winner:** FlipChecker for lower overhead and simpler tech stack

## Long-Term Sustainability

**Amazon Arbitrage Challenges:**

- Fee increases erode margins every year
- Platform policy changes can kill niches overnight
- Account suspension risk is always present
- Competition increases as more sellers use the same tools

**FlipChecker/Marketplace Arbitrage Advantages:**

- Peer-to-peer marketplaces aren't going away (people always have stuff to sell)
- eBay has been reseller-friendly for 25+ years
- Local sourcing creates unique inventory moats
- Skill-based advantage (negotiation, item knowledge) vs. tool-based advantage

**Winner:** FlipChecker for long-term resilience

## Making the Switch: Transitioning from Amazon to FlipChecker

If you're currently doing Amazon arbitrage and considering FlipChecker:

**Step 1: Test Alongside Amazon**

Don't quit Amazon cold turkey. Spend 5 hours per week using FlipChecker to source from Facebook Marketplace. List on eBay. Track profits separately.

**Step 2: Compare ROI and Time Investment**

After 30 days, compare:
- Profit per hour (FlipChecker vs. Amazon arbitrage)
- Cash flow speed
- Stress level and enjoyment

**Step 3: Double Down on What Works**

If FlipChecker yields better hourly profit and cash flow, gradually shift more time to Facebook Marketplace sourcing. Keep Amazon for large bulk opportunities.

**Step 4: Build Expertise in Specific Categories**

FlipChecker rewards niche knowledge. Pick 2-3 categories (vintage electronics, designer clothing, collectibles) and become an expert. This creates sustainable competitive advantages.

For detailed category breakdowns, see our guide to the [best items to flip on Facebook Marketplace](/blog/best-items-to-flip-on-facebook-marketplace-2026).

## Success Stories: Resellers Who Made the Switch

**Case Study 1: Former Amazon Arbitrage Seller**

"I was doing $8,000/month on Amazon FBA with retail arbitrage. After two account suspensions and six months of stagnant growth, I tried FlipChecker. First month I did $2,500 profit on eBay with half the stress. Six months later I'm at $6,000/month with better margins and no inventory fees. I still do some Amazon, but FlipChecker is now my primary income."

**Case Study 2: Beginner Flipper**

"Amazon scared me with all the fees and rules. FlipChecker made sense immediately: find cheap stuff on Facebook, check eBay prices, buy and flip. Made $300 my first month, $800 my third month. Still part-time but it's real money with low risk."

**Case Study 3: Multi-Platform Power Seller**

"I use Tactical Arbitrage for Amazon, FlipChecker for Facebook Marketplace to eBay, and Keepa for Walmart to Amazon. Different tools for different sourcing strategies. FlipChecker has the best profit-per-hour because the competition is lower and I'm not waiting for FBA shipments."

## Common Objections to FlipChecker

**Objection 1: "I don't want to meet strangers for pickups."**

Valid concern. Many FlipChecker users set guidelines: meet in public places (police station parking lots, busy coffee shops), bring a friend, trust your instincts. Or focus on items sellers will ship.

**Objection 2: "Facebook Marketplace inventory is inconsistent."**

True. You can't source 100 identical items like Amazon arbitrage. But that's also why competition is lower. Successful FlipChecker users browse daily and jump on deals fast.

**Objection 3: "eBay is old and declining."**

eBay's active buyer base is still 138 million globally. While it's not growing like Amazon, it's stable and reseller-friendly. Plus, you can cross-list to Mercari, Poshmark, etc.

**Objection 4: "I can make more money with Amazon FBA."**

At scale, yes. Amazon FBA with $20,000+ inventory and automation can generate $10,000+ monthly profit. But it requires significant capital, systems, and risk tolerance. FlipChecker is better for $500-5,000/month with low capital and low risk.

## The Future of Arbitrage: Platform Diversification

The smartest resellers don't put all their eggs in one platform's basket.

**Recommended Strategy for 2026:**

- **40% of time:** Facebook Marketplace to eBay (FlipChecker)
- **30% of time:** Amazon FBA for bulk/wholesale opportunities
- **20% of time:** Cross-listing inventory to Mercari, Poshmark, etc.
- **10% of time:** Learning new platforms (WhatNot, Depop, StockX)

This diversification protects you from algorithm changes, fee increases, and policy shifts on any single platform.
