faqs:
  - question: "What types of furniture are most profitable to flip from Facebook Marketplace?"
    answer: "Mid-century modern pieces, designer brands (Herman Miller, Pottery Barn, West Elm), solid wood furniture, and vintage pieces typically offer $150-700 profit per item with strong resale demand."
  - question: "Do I need to refinish furniture before reselling it?"
    answer: "Not always. Clean, structurally sound pieces in good condition can be sold as-is. Light cleaning, tightening hardware, and minor touch-ups often provide the best ROI. Full refinishing is only worthwhile for high-value pieces where the investment justifies the effort."
  - question: "How do I ship large furniture items I buy for local pickup?"
    answer: "Use freight shipping services like uShip, FreightCenter, or Greyhound Package Express for national sales. Alternatively, focus on local resale via Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or OfferUp to avoid shipping complexity and costs."
  - question: "Can beginners make money flipping furniture without restoration skills?"
    answer: "Yes. Start with brand-name furniture in good condition that requires only cleaning. Herman Miller chairs, Pottery Barn tables, and West Elm pieces maintain value without restoration and are easier for beginners."

Furniture flipping represents one of the highest-profit opportunities on Facebook Marketplace, but it requires different skills than typical eBay arbitrage. Large items mean local pickup, space for storage, and either local resale or freight shipping logistics.

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to flip furniture profitably: identifying valuable pieces, basic restoration techniques, photography for large items, pricing strategies, and whether to ship or sell locally.

## Why Furniture Flipping Is Uniquely Profitable

Furniture combines several advantages that create exceptional arbitrage opportunities:

**High profit per transaction**: A single mid-century modern credenza can yield $300-700 profit, compared to $40-80 for typical small electronics flips.

**Less competition**: Most Facebook Marketplace flippers focus on easily-shipped items, leaving furniture underserved. This is especially true for [local arbitrage opportunities](/blog/best-local-arbitrage-opportunities-facebook-marketplace).

**Emotional pricing**: Furniture sellers often price based on urgency (moving, downsizing, divorce) rather than market value, creating pricing inefficiencies.

**Tangible expertise**: Unlike electronics where counterfeits abound, furniture expertise develops through recognizing construction quality, styles, and brands—skills that compound over time.

**Multiple resale channels**: You can sell locally (Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, OfferUp), ship nationally (eBay, Chairish, 1stDibs), or use hybrid approaches.

## Best Furniture Styles and Eras to Flip

Not all furniture styles command equal resale value. Focus on these proven categories.

## Identifying Quality Furniture Worth Flipping

Learning to spot valuable furniture separates profitable flippers from those who fill their garage with unsellable items.

### Construction Quality Indicators

**Dovetail joints**: Look inside drawers. Machine-cut dovetails (uniform) are good. Hand-cut dovetails (irregular) are excellent and indicate pre-1900s construction or high-end modern craftsmanship.

**Solid wood vs. veneer**: Veneer isn't bad—MCM pieces often use walnut veneer over hardwood. But veneer over particleboard (post-1980s mass market) has minimal resale value.

**Joinery methods**: Mortise and tenon joints, finger joints, and dowel joints indicate quality. Staples and glue-only construction suggest low-value items.

**Hardware**: Original brass or bronze hardware adds value. Replacement hardware is acceptable if period-appropriate, but original is preferred.

**Drawer slides**: Wood-on-wood slides or ball-bearing slides indicate quality. Cheap plastic slides suggest low-end construction.

### Wood Type and Finish

**High-value woods**: Walnut, teak, mahogany, cherry, oak, maple. These maintain value and are worth refinishing if needed.

**Medium-value woods**: Pine, birch, ash. Can be valuable depending on construction and style.

**Avoid**: Particleboard, MDF, laminate (unless designer brand like IKEA vintage pieces, which are a small niche).

### Size Considerations

**Best sizes**: Dining tables under 72", dressers under 60" wide, chairs and small tables. These are easiest to transport and fit most homes.

**Challenging sizes**: Dining tables over 96", sectional sofas, king beds. These require larger vehicles, freight shipping, or local-only sales.

**Optimal strategy**: Start with smaller items (chairs, side tables, small dressers) before tackling large pieces.

## Basic Restoration and Preparation

You don't need to be a master woodworker, but basic furniture prep skills multiply your profit potential.

### Cleaning and Polishing

Most furniture only needs deep cleaning, not full refinishing.

**Wood cleaner**: Use Murphy Oil Soap or specialized wood cleaner to remove decades of grime. You'd be amazed how much better a piece looks after proper cleaning.

**Furniture polish**: Apply furniture polish or wax (Howard Feed-N-Wax, Minwax Paste Wax) to restore luster.

**Hardware cleaning**: Remove hardware, soak in vinegar or brass cleaner, scrub with an old toothbrush, polish, and reinstall.

**Upholstery**: For light stains, use upholstery cleaner. For odors, use Febreze or enzyme cleaners. For significant damage, factor reupholstery costs into purchase price.

**Time investment**: 1-2 hours per piece for basic cleaning typically yields 20-40% higher resale prices.

### Minor Repairs

**Tightening joints**: Many older pieces just need wood glue injected into loose joints and clamping overnight.

**Drawer repair**: If drawers stick, rub candle wax on slides or sand edges slightly. If drawer fronts are loose, reattach with wood glue and small clamps.

**Touch-up markers and pens**: For small scratches, use wood touch-up markers matching the finish color. These cost $5-10 and are invaluable.

**Wood filler**: For small gouges or dents, use wood filler, sand smooth, and touch up with stain marker.

**Time investment**: 1-3 hours for minor repairs on most pieces.

### When to Refinish (and When Not To)

Full refinishing (stripping, sanding, staining, sealing) is time-intensive and requires proper space and equipment.

**Refinish when**:
- The piece has high underlying value ($400+ resale potential after refinishing)
- Finish is severely damaged (deep scratches, water damage, peeling veneer)
- You have refinishing skills and equipment
- Your time investment is justified by profit increase

**Don't refinish when**:
- Piece is antique (original finish often increases value)
- Surface damage is minor (cleaning and touch-ups are sufficient)
- Your time is better spent sourcing more pieces
- Piece won't command premium pricing even after refinishing

**ROI calculation**: If refinishing takes 8 hours and increases sale price by $150, you're earning $18.75/hour. Compare this to your time value and sourcing opportunities.

For most beginners, focus on pieces that need only cleaning and minor repairs. This maximizes ROI and teaches you to identify quality before tackling restoration projects.

## Photography Tips for Large Furniture Items

Quality photos overcome the challenge of buyers unable to see furniture in person.

### Setup and Staging

**Clean backdrop**: Photograph against neutral walls (white, beige, light gray). Avoid cluttered backgrounds that distract from the piece.

**Natural lighting**: Shoot during daytime near large windows. Avoid harsh overhead lights that create unflattering shadows.

**Multiple angles**: Take photos from front, both sides, back (if visible details exist), top (for tables), and detail shots of hardware, joints, maker's marks, and any damage.

**Stage appropriately**: For tables, add a simple centerpiece or place setting. For chairs, position in a room setting if possible. For dressers, style the top with a lamp or decor.

**Show scale**: Include common objects (books, vases) or room context to help buyers visualize size.

### Detail Shots

**Maker's marks**: Photograph any labels, stamps, or signatures clearly. These often sell the piece to knowledgeable buyers.

**Construction quality**: Close-ups of dovetail joints, wood grain, hardware add perceived value.

**Damage disclosure**: Photograph any scratches, dings, or imperfections. Transparency prevents returns and builds trust.

**Hardware**: Clear photos of original hardware appeal to collectors.

### Photo Count and Order

**Recommended count**: 8-12 photos for most furniture pieces. More for high-value items ($1,000+).

**Optimal order**:
1. Hero shot (best angle, full piece)
2. Front straight-on
3. Side views (both sides)
4. Top view (tables, dressers)
5. Back view (if relevant)
6. Close-ups (hardware, maker's marks, wood grain)
7. Detail shots (joints, special features)
8. Damage disclosure shots

## Pricing Strategies for Furniture

Furniture pricing differs from typical eBay arbitrage due to local market dynamics.

### Research Process

1. **eBay sold listings**: Use [FlipChecker](/guide/how-to-use-flipchecker) to see what similar pieces actually sold for nationally.

2. **Local market research**: Search sold listings on Facebook Marketplace in your area. Furniture sells at regional price variations (higher in NYC/SF/LA, lower in rural areas).

3. **Specialized platforms**: For high-end pieces, research Chairish, 1stDibs, and AptDeco for pricing benchmarks.

4. **Adjust for condition**: If comparables are "excellent" and yours is "good," reduce price 15-25%.

### Local vs. Shipped Pricing

**Local sale pricing**: Price 20-40% below eBay shipped prices. You avoid shipping costs and reach buyers who want immediate possession.

**Shipped sale pricing**: Match eBay pricing but clearly communicate shipping costs upfront. Offer local pickup as an option.

**Hybrid approach**: List on eBay with "Local Pickup or Buyer Arranges Shipping." This captures both markets and lets the highest-paying channel win.

### Timing and Negotiation

**Best listing times**: Thursday-Sunday for weekend project shoppers. Avoid Monday-Tuesday listings.

**Seasonal patterns**: Furniture sells best April-October (moving season, spring cleaning). Slower November-February except holiday-adjacent periods.

**Negotiation buffer**: List 10-15% above your minimum acceptable price. Most buyers will negotiate, and this leaves room for them to feel they got a deal.

## Shipping Furniture: When and How

Large furniture shipping is complex but opens national markets.

### When to Ship

**High-value items ($600+ resale)**: Shipping costs ($100-300) are justified by accessing national buyer pools.

**Lightweight items**: Chairs, small tables, and lightweight dressers ship more affordably than heavy solid wood pieces.

**Unique pieces**: Rare or designer items often warrant shipping to find the right buyer.

### Freight Shipping Options

**uShip**: Marketplace connecting shippers with carriers. Competitive bidding often yields lowest rates. Good for $100-200 shipping needs.

**FreightCenter**: Freight broker with established carrier relationships. Reliable for larger items.

**Greyhound Package Express**: Surprisingly affordable for items that fit within size limits. Check your local Greyhound station.

**Regional carriers**: Research regional furniture delivery services in your area. Sometimes local carriers beat national options.

### Packaging for Shipping

**Blanket wrapping**: Professional furniture blankets prevent scratches. Secure with stretch wrap.

**Corner protection**: Use foam corners or cardboard edge protectors on all corners and edges.

**Disassembly**: Remove legs from tables, separate chair bases from seats, take drawers out of dressers. This reduces shipping volume and damage risk.

**Crating**: For high-value items ($1,500+), consider professional crating. Costs $100-300 but dramatically reduces damage risk.

**Insurance**: Always purchase shipping insurance for valuable items. Cost is typically 2-3% of declared value.

## Local-Only Selling Strategy

Many successful furniture flippers never ship, focusing exclusively on local markets.

### Advantages of Local-Only

- No shipping costs or complexity
- No packaging requirements beyond transport protection
- Buyers inspect before purchase (fewer returns)
- Cash transactions (no eBay fees)
- Faster inventory turnover

### Local Selling Platforms

**Facebook Marketplace**: Largest audience, integrated messaging, good for $100-1,500 items.

**Craigslist**: Older demographic, still strong for furniture. Good for $200-2,000 items.

**OfferUp**: Mobile-first platform, growing furniture category.

**Nextdoor**: Neighborhood-focused, ideal for $100-600 items. Less haggling than other platforms.

**Estate sales**: Once you build inventory, host your own estate-style sale. Move volume quickly.

### Local Marketing Tips

**Cross-post**: List on all platforms simultaneously. Different audiences check different sites.

**Detailed descriptions**: Since buyers can't see items in person until pickup, describe construction, wood type, measurements, and condition thoroughly.

**Measurements**: Always include dimensions (height, width, depth). Include drawer dimensions for dressers.

**Flexible pickup times**: Offer evening and weekend pickup windows. Buyers with day jobs appreciate this.

**Staged photos**: Show furniture in a room setting when possible, not just in a garage or storage space.

## Common Furniture Flipping Mistakes

Avoid these pitfalls that trap new furniture flippers:

**Buying unsellable styles**: Tuscan-style furniture, heavy oak '90s furniture, and particleboard pieces rarely flip profitably. Stick to proven styles.

**Overestimating condition**: Your "excellent" may be a buyer's "fair." Grade conservatively and price accordingly.

**Underestimating space requirements**: A garage full of furniture you can't move fast ties up capital and space. Start small.

**Skipping measurements**: Furniture that doesn't fit through doorways has no value. Always confirm dimensions before buying large pieces.

**Ignoring structural issues**: Wobbly chairs, broken drawer slides, and loose joints need repair before resale. Factor repair time/cost into purchase decisions.

**Refinishing low-value pieces**: Don't spend 10 hours refinishing a dresser that sells for $180. Your time is worth more.

**Poor transportation**: Damaged furniture during transport destroys profit. Use blankets, tie-downs, and appropriate vehicles.

## Building Furniture Flipping Expertise

Furniture flipping rewards specialized knowledge that compounds over time:

**Study styles**: Spend time on 1stDibs, Chairish, and design blogs learning to identify periods, makers, and valuable characteristics.

**Follow makers**: Create Facebook Marketplace searches for "Herman Miller," "Lane," "Broyhill Brasilia," "Heywood Wakefield," etc.

**Join communities**: Facebook groups like "Mid-Century Modern Finds" and "Furniture Flipping" provide identification help and market insights.

**Build relationships**: Develop relationships with estate sale companies, antique dealers, and consignment shops who can tip you off to incoming inventory.

**Track your numbers**: Record purchase price, repair costs, time invested, sale price, and profit for every flip. This data reveals your most profitable categories.

## Scaling Your Furniture Flipping Business

Once you've mastered individual flips, consider scaling:

**Volume approach**: Flip 8-12 smaller pieces ($150-300 profit each) monthly for $1,200-3,600 monthly profit.

**High-value approach**: Flip 2-4 premium pieces ($400-800 profit each) monthly for $800-3,200 monthly profit.

**Hybrid approach**: Maintain cash flow with regular pieces while pursuing occasional high-end items.

**Restoration specialization**: Develop refinishing skills to unlock pieces other flippers pass on.

**Wholesale buying**: Once you prove concept, buy furniture lots from estate sales, auctions, or storage unit auctions at bulk discounts.
